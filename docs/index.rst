amaGama documentation
=====================

amaGama is a web service implementing a large-scale translation memory. A
translation memory is a database of previous translations which can be searched
to find good matches to new strings.

amaGama is implemented in Python on top of PostgreSQL. There are currently no
releases of the software, but the `source code is available at Github
<https://github.com/translate/amagama>`_.

A `public deployment <http://amagama.locamotion.org>`_ of amaGama is available
and is usable from `Virtaal <http://virtaal.org>`_ and the development version
of `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`_.

If you are able to help with extra hosting, even if just for specific languages,
please contact the project developers.
