amaGama: a web translation memory server
========================================

`amaGama <http://amagama.translatehouse.org/>`_ is a web service implementing a
large-scale translation memory. A translation memory is a database of previous
translations which can be searched to find good matches to new strings.

   Translate Toolkit's tmserver to PostgreSQL.

* Simple web interface
* Custom index config for source languages not supported by default postgres install
* Keep track of file's mtime to avoid expensive reparses

* Use more permanent caching of levenshtein distances?
* Use PostgreSQL built-in Levenshtein functions?
* Document API
