amaGama: a web translation memory server
========================================

`amaGama <http://amagama.translatehouse.org>`_ is a web service written in
Python implementing a large-scale translation memory on top of PostgreSQL. A
translation memory is a database of previous translations which can be searched
to find good matches to new strings.

There are currently no releases of amaGama, but the source code is available in
the `https://github.com/translate/amagama
<https://github.com/translate/amagama>`_ repository.

A public deployment of amaGama is available at `http://amagama.locamotion.org
<http://amagama.locamotion.org>`_. Check the documentation to learn how to use
it.
